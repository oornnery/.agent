# Workflows

Workflows are manually triggered macros.

## Available

- `technical-planning.md`: flow to generate a detailed technical plan from a base prompt.
- `repo-instructions.md`: generate or refresh repository AI instructions from codebase truth.
- `handoff.md`: persist session state and resume context deterministically.
- `validate-kb.md`: validate docs/skills/agents consistency and broken references.

## Convention

- Each workflow should be short and operational.
- Long prompts should live in `.agent/prompts/`.
