# Skills (On-Demand)

Skills are on-demand plugins. Each skill should keep a short, operational `SKILL.md`.

## Active Skills

- `code-review`
- `context-map`
- `design-system`
- `explorer`
- `git-workflow`
- `go`
- `handoff`
- `node`
- `python`
- `python/fastapi`
- `python/faststream`
- `python/jx`
- `python/test-runner`
- `rust`

## Convention

- `SKILL.md` should define scope, triggers, and loading order.
- Complementary content should stay inside the skill's own folder.
- Avoid duplicating global rules inside skills.

## Node Skill Note

`node` is flexible by repository stack and manager/runtime:

- language profile docs: `typescript`/`js`
- manager/runtime docs: `bun`, `pnpm`, `npm`
